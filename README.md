# Academic Success Predictions

This project aims to predict students' academic success based on various demographic, social, and academic factors. The model is built using machine learning techniques and is designed to analyze how different variables, such as family background, study time, and past academic performance, influence a student's likelihood of achieving high grades. By leveraging this predictive model, educators and institutions can identify at-risk students early on and tailor interventions to improve their academic outcomes.

The dataset used for this project includes features like age, gender, family income, study time, and previous grades. The project explores different machine learning algorithms to find the most accurate model for predicting academic success. This tool can be valuable for educational institutions looking to enhance student performance and overall academic achievement through data-driven decision-making.
